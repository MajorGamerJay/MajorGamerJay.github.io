<h1 id="My%20notes%20on%20&amp;#8220;Nature%20of%20Tragedy&amp;#8221;%20and%20my%20opinions%20on%20it">My notes on &#8220;Nature of Tragedy&#8221; and my opinions on it</h1>

<p>These are my notes on the 98 pages book <strong><em>Nature of Tragedy</em></strong> by M.M. Sharif,
Asiatic Publishers. This book is a criticism and realization of Aristotle&#8217;s
theory of imitation and the nature of tragedy in imitative art.</p>

<p>This is a really good and informative book published in 1947 based on the
transcript of his lectures. But due to a short amount of time, I could not
get enough time to write detailed notes on it and therefore rushed a summary
of the three chapters that is discussed by the book.</p>

<h3 id="Four%20basic%20elements%20of%20emotional%20imitations">Four basic elements of emotional imitations</h3>

<p>Art, to be used as a method for conveying emotion, requires imitation of similar
objects or events that gives us the emotion. As a result, art can be derived
into smaller means of classification to make the expression of art easier. These
basic elements of emotional imitation are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Means</p>

<p>Mean is an important aspect of creating emotional imitation. It is the form of
art through which the emotion is expressed. Such as plays, poetry, drama or
literature.</p></li>
<li><p>Manner of imitations</p>

<p>The manner of imitation dictates the flow and movement of the art which will
produce emotion in the spectators&#8217; mind. Such as the tragic movement of a play
to produce pity.</p></li>
<li><p>Object imitated</p>

<p>Object of imitation is of utmost importance in producing emotional imitation. The object
may be the plot of the story of a human being, or the moral implications of an action
or anything in our world of common sense that we can attach emotions to.</p></li>
<li><p>Aim of imitation</p>

<p>The aim of the imitation may determine the effect of the imitation and the
type of imitation it should be. Such as, if the aim of an imitation is to produce
pity, then we may classify it as a tragedy. Similarly, if the aim is to produce
fear, then we may call it a horror. If it is to produce humor, then it is a
comedy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For tragedy to be fully realized according to Aristotle, it requires dramatic 
scenes, strange and drapery elements to go with realization.</p>

<h3 id="Tragedy%20should%20include%20these%20characteristics">Tragedy should include these characteristics</h3>

<ol>
<li>Plot:

<ol>
<li>Serious incidents having magnitude</li>
<li>Comprehensible, not too long, not too short. Should lie in domain of
common sense and logical thought.</li>
<li>Should be complete. Has to have a complete ending to the plot.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Course of transition:

<ol>
<li>Peripety - Change of one state of things to its opposite.</li>
<li>Complication - Movement from beginning to change.</li>
<li>Denouement - Movement from change to end.</li>
<li>Discovery - Climactic point of sudden recognition of his impending doom.</li>
<li>Suffering - Not by vice&#47;depravity, but rather by err of judgement.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Basic%20aim%20of%20simple%20tragedy">Basic aim of simple tragedy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Produce <em>catharsis</em> from pity&#47;fear</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="On%20producing%20tragedy%20based%20on%20the%20movement%20of%20art">On producing tragedy based on the movement of art</h3>

<p>Effect of tragedy also depends on the movement of art. The more dynamic the form
of art is, the more it tends to produce pity in the minds of the spectators.
In case of art, any form can be used to express tragedy as long as it imitates
the tragic movement. Movement from prosperity to undeserving misery that is.
Even a series of sculpture or paintings that expresses the demise of a person
or the tragedy of a story can also produce pity in the spectators.</p>

<p>A summarized comparison of different means are:</p>

<p>Series of sculptures&#47;paintings &#60; Songs &#60; Written plays &#60; Literature&#47;Poetry<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="On%20Aristotleian%20Tragedy">On Aristotleian Tragedy</h3>

<p>Tragedy does not have to be Aristotelian only.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Tragedy contains characters who may not be innocent&#47;normal or may be in misery
and then proceed to a greater misery.</p>

<p>Tragedy does not rule out <strong>&#8220;extremely bad&#8221;</strong> heroes. When it does introduce them,
the tragic effect is achieved by equally <em>unmerited suffering of others</em>. It
counterbalances the lack of pitiable elements in the hero.</p>

<p><strong>Euripedes</strong>, the most tragic poet regarded by Aristotle, most of his characters
are extremely evil. (See Medea, Electra)</p>

<h4 id="The%20mechanism%20is%20thought%20to%20be%20as%20followed">The mechanism is thought to be as followed</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pity is achieved by display of undeserved misfortune.</li>
<li>Merited suffering causes less pity than suffering of innocent bystanders.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Examining%20Medea&amp;#8217;s%20case%20of%20tragedy">Examining Medea&#8217;s case of tragedy</h4>

<ol>
<li>Her villany causes suffering of others, producing pity in the spectators.</li>
<li>Her victimization from <em>Jason&#8217;s betrayal</em> and <em>Aphrodite&#47;Artemis&#8217; curses</em>
supposedly should produce pity in spectators.</li>
</ol>

<p>But both of these are only theoretical, may not work practically all the time.</p>

<p>Euripedes&#8217; tragedies mostly contain <em>passion as the driving force of disaster</em>,
unlike Aristotle&#8217;s err of judgement. We pity someone when he is driven by his
natural impulses to cause a disaster, because that is by nature, undeserving to
both the victim and the hero.</p>

<p>Another characteristics of Euripedean tragedies is that the environment drives
the character into a tragic misery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Environment compells Medea to cause calamity. Medea therefore causes calamity
to the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, Euripedes&#8217; tragedies are usually regarded as <em>tragedies of the society</em>
than tragedies of the person.</p>

<p>Since M.M. Sharif in his book frequently compares and mentions these plays for
comparing tragedies and elements of tragedies, noting them so I will read&#47;watch
later:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shakesparean:

<ol>
<li>Hamlet</li>
<li>King Lear</li>
<li>Macbeth</li>
<li>Othello</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Euripedean and Sophocles&#8217; Tragedy (particularly Medea and Electra)</li>
<li>Schiller&#8217;s, <em>Don Carlos</em></li>
<li>Ibsen&#8217;s plays</li>
<li>Richards, Principles of Literary Criticism</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Tragic%20idea%20as%20the%20basis%20of%20Tragedy">Tragic idea as the basis of Tragedy</h3>

<p>Tragic idea, as <em>Kitto</em> observes, runs more than tragic action.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220; The drama arises through conflict of ideas rather than vulgar attachments,
rapacities, generosities, resentment, ambitions, misunderstanding, oddities and
form. &#8220; &#8211; <cite>Bernard Shaw, Quintessence of Ibsenism</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aristotle realized that in actual life, if calamity falls upon our close
relatives, we feel terror rather than pity. Fear produces terror, opposite of
pity. There are two conditions according to Aristotle that evoke pity into the
minds of a spectator:</p>

<ol>
<li>Danger to a person other than ourselves.</li>
<li>Absence of any close relation between the person and us.</li>
</ol>

<p>And a third optional condition, which enhances the effectiveness of producing
pity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Impossibility to help. <em>Even if the spectators had means to help</em>. This
intensifies the pity&#47;changes our sympathy into pity. Fueling the catharsis as a
result.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the person watching the tragedy ascertains the fact that it is merely
fiction, and the characters are not in relation to him, the pre-eminent fear
in tragedy becomes pity in the viewer. (<em>But this theory of Aristotle is proved
wrong</em>). For a better understanding of producing pity through tragic movement, read:</p>

<ol>
<li>Schiller&#8217;s Essay, <em>On Tragic Art</em></li>
<li><em>Cordelia</em>, <em>Ophelia</em> - Shakesparean</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Understanding%20Catharsis">Understanding Catharsis</h3>

<h4 id="Defining%20catharsis">Defining catharsis</h4>

<p>Aristotle has produced many controversies by defining the word &#8220;<em>catharsis</em>&#8221;.</p>

<p><em>Catharsis</em>, by uniting different philosophers&#8217; interpretation, definition of it
is,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Is the natural relief and purification of emotions through removal of their
superfluous strength by their temporary and artificial inducement and thereby
creation of a healthy, and in consequence, a morally desirable state in spectators&#8217;
minds.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read <em>F.L. Lucas, Tragedy</em> for better understanding the mechanism of catharsis
and <em>Humayun Kabir&#8217;s Poetry, Monad and Society</em> for tragic movement of catharsis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Tragedy does not purgate the disease. It creates the disease and then cures it.&#8221;
&#8211; <cite> Humayun Kabir, Poetry, Monad and Society </cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, the disease is <em>fear</em> and the cure is <em>pity</em>.</p>

<h4 id="Catharsis%20of%20the%20artist">Catharsis of the artist</h4>

<p>But tragedy in a sense when created by an artist, does not produce catharsis in
spectators but is a reflection of the catharsis of the artist. Humayun Kabir also
quotes,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Tragedy yields a catharsis of artist&#8217;s impulses and emotions before that of
contemplator.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Dr. Lock</em> says summing up Keble&#8217;s theory of poetry in <em>Biography of Keble</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;is essentialy a relief to the poet, a relief for overcharged emotions&#8221;&#8230;.
&#8220;It is the utterance of feelings which struggled for expression but which are
too deep for perfect expression at all, much more for expression in life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I quote <em>M.M. Sharif</em> directly from his book <em>Nature of Tragedy</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In tragic art, the artist gets an outlet for his suppressed impulses and
emotions. His tendencies of love, admiration, sympathy, self-elation, curiosity,
anger, fear and so on, gush forth, with the help of his consciousness, in the
form of tragic agents, like gods, ghosts, kings, queens, soldiers, sailors,
murderers, murderesses, and in scenes like parlours, courts, gardens, battlefields
as substitute of life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it removes the pent up emotions of the artist who otherwise, would have
become madmen, poetry and tragedy, is therefore cathartic. That is why we are
more allured to embrace deviant art of rarity compared to common creation of
talent. Our curiosity tempts us to explore the mind of the artist as the art is
analyzed by our mind. Tragedy is similar in this regard. Cruel movement draws
pity and curiosity out of the spectator which allows them to feel catharsis by 
exploring the mind of the artist and his agenda in his art.</p>

<p>Free association writing therefore produces catharsis in mentally ill patients.
It allows them to realize their accumulated emotions and lets it gush forth into
words or drawings written on pen and paper.</p>

<p>Shelley has said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our sweetest songs are those that tell of the saddest thought&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Artist&#8217;s catharsis can be transferred to spectator&#8217;s mind when he is in the same
frame as the artist.</p>

<p>Aristotle&#8217;s theory of tragedy producing catharsis is correct but is wrongly
directed towards the contemplator whereas the catharsis on the contemplator
is just a reflection of the catharsis of the artist, albeit a weakened reflection
that is.</p>

<h3 id="Art,%20Mimesis%20and%20Tragedy">Art, Mimesis and Tragedy</h3>

<p>Imitation or <em>Mimesis</em> by Aristotle says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An imitation produces the same emotions that would be produced by the action
of that imitation in actual life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this regard, Aristotle thinks music is the pinnacle of melody.</p>

<p>And supporting this, M.M. Sharif says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Melody of a music can copy the rhythm of our experiences, succession of our
actions, emotions of different events. Starting from our roars of laughter,
shouts of joy, screams of pain, shrieks of terror, thunders in rage and wails
in woe, music is the most imitative out of all objects of mimesis in regards of
conveying emotions. Music can copy our success and failure, our weakness and
strength, the beating of our hearts and the swinging of our legs and arms in
suspense. Music does not only represent the physical expression of our emotions,
impulses, volitions and thoughts, but it also represents the suddenness and
storminess of anger, sharpness and shortness of temper, strength and dominance
of courage, fineness and acuteness of intellect, extent and depth of knowledge,
oscillations of indecision, balance of justice and likewise, it imitates the
physical expressions of our daily life and as well as the quality of our
experiences in their universal forms, it is regarded as imitative of all arts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Universality apart, it can imitate qualities of our character, actions and
emotions and their concreteness more truly than architecture, sculpture, dancing,
painting and even poetry.</p>

<p>But music itself is subjective. Subjective in a sense that a genre of music in 
one culture may not regarded as the same genre in another culture. So to apply
this logic, there must be an expanded exposure to music for the spectators, so
they can distinguish hidden emotions by acquiring stimuli from the music.</p>

<h4 id="Hegel&amp;#8217;s%20dispute%20with%20Mimesis">Hegel&#8217;s dispute with Mimesis</h4>

<p><em>Hegel</em> rejects imitation and mimesis and believes that imitation is not adequate
enough to support the theory of mimesis, meaning it cannot induce the same or
give equal magnitude of emotions to the spectator.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In my opinion, Hegels theories are correct. According to M.M. Sharif, if nature
is copied exact to exact, then it cannot reproduce the same emotions as seen
for the first time. An example given by M.M. Sharif is an apple drawn as 
perfectly as possible cannot give the same emotions we develop when seeing the 
apple for the first time in reality. The only thing that impresses the 
spectator is the background behind drawing of the apple, such as the talent 
required, the story behind it etc. which becomes the main focus, not the object
of the art itself. So, we have to see art as a construction of original imitation
and added beautification.</p>

<h4 id="Art%20as%20a%20construction">Art as a construction</h4>

<p>The beauty of an art, does not depend on imitation alone. If additional
beautification of an art is taken into amount, it is still an authentic art,
an object of uniqueness and creativity. And it is not due to imitation.
Although Aristotle contributes all of his theory of ideal art to mimesis alone,
he himself admits that art results from objective stimuli or the knowledge,
color, rhythm, uniqueness etc. about the art.</p>

<p>So therefore,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Art is a construction&#8230; not an imitation and thus, tragedy is a construction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The characters in a tragic play, have distinctive qualities of characters and
thought, but these qualities are not seen in any general human because these
characters are based on the relation to human life in piteous and fearful
aspects. Tragedies are not imitations of anything. They are creations of the
elements supplied partly by nature and the artist.</p>

<p>Art is an imitation, not of actual life, but from imagination of the artist. His
imagination, his feelings, even if it is taken from the gruesome of reality,
enhanced with even more messed up elements, like the Medea of Euripedes,
converges with his art, produces catharsis to the artist and in pity to the
contemplator.</p>
