<p>Here is music streaming from my laptop. If the music doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s either
your browser doesn&#8217;t support music or no music is being played on my laptop. Usually
there should be music playing on my laptop unless my laptop is in maintenance or I&#8217;m
away from home. Most probably it&#8217;s the first one because in case of the latter one, I
would&#8217;ve notified.</p>
