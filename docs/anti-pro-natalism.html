<h1 id="My%20stance%20on%20anti-natalism&amp;#47;pro-natalism">My stance on anti-natalism&#47;pro-natalism</h1>

<p>I am no expert in this topic and I haven&#8217;t researched about
this much but I did talk to a few people who supports
natalism and are against natalism.</p>

<h3 id="What%20is%20Natalism?">What is Natalism?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Natalism is the belief that promotes reproduction of life.</em>
- John McKeown<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically the belief that having children are a good
thing&#47;compulsory(in some cases) is known as natalism. And
people who are against that, are anti-Natalists.</p>

<p>So at first glance, anti-natalism may sound absurd but it
is, in fact logical from many perspectives. Just to clarify,
by anti-natalism, I do not mean forced anti-natalism, which
itself is violation of free will.</p>

<p>While Natalism is seen as a moral obligation or sometimes
just promotion of having children and anti-natalism is also
seen the same but it counters the ethics of having children.</p>

<p>Both ideologies&#47;beliefs try to justify the ethics and
morality to give&#47;not give birth to children and both in
senses, have their own facts and logic.</p>

<h3 id="Depiction%20of%20Natalism%20and%20Anti-Natalism%20in%20culture%20and%20media">Depiction of Natalism and Anti-Natalism in culture and media</h3>

<p>Natalism and anti-natalism are often portrayed and depicted
in modern culture and media. It was also a topic discussed
in ancient culture in old civilizations.</p>

<p>Historians date Natalism movements back to
ancient civilizations. Especially in Abrahamic religions such as
Islam, Christianity, Judaism etc. where people were encouraged
to be Natalists to continue fertility rate and increase
population.</p>

<p>The concept of anti-natalism and its popularity movement is
a new thing. Not really new but it is seen a lot more now than
before mostly due to industrialization and the robotic
workflow us people go through now.</p>

<p>People in a few countries such as Japan prefers
anti-natalism and they reason their cause on it. I will get
more on that later. Video games and media such as <em>Half-Life
2</em> series or the anime <em>Darling in the Franxx</em><sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> promotes
natalism in a few ways.</p>

<p>Most of the reasons showed towards both sides are
conditional&#47;adheres to the environment they are talking
about. For example, in scenario A natalism would make sense
and in scenario B, it does not make sense. And sometimes
both ideologies are encouraged by external obligations such
as religious and social beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="People&amp;#8217;s%20reason%20to%20be%20Natalists&amp;#47;Anti-natalists">People&#8217;s reason to be Natalists&#47;Anti-natalists</h3>

<p>Here, I have oversimplified the arguments of Natalists and
anti-natalists. Some of these may not be accurate or maybe
more but this article is about my two cents on the topic, so
I am just displaying this to try to make an objective sense
about this to the reader.</p>

<h4 id="Arguments%20of%20Natalists:">Arguments of Natalists:</h4>

<p>There are vast arguments for Natalism since most of us grew
up with this mindset, most of them are related to normal
affairs of the world. Anyone can think them up in a bit so
I&#8217;m not going to display them here.</p>

<h4 id="Arguments%20of%20Anti-Natalists:">Arguments of Anti-Natalists:</h4>

<p>There are TONS of arguments about anti-natalism and that
cannot be covered nor a lot of them I don&#8217;t know. Since as I
said before, this article is just my two cents about this
topic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Impossibility of consent.

<ul>
<li>You cannot determine the fact that your children
wanted to be in this world. This is an important topic
to think about as this world may work in their favor
or may work against them. Which ultimately brings the
fault to the parent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Death is a harm.

<ul>
<li>People have to die someday and that is a miserable
thing to leave this world. So a lot of people wishe
sthat they weren&#8217;t born.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dissatisfactory life

<ul>
<li>This is self-explanatory. :&#8217;(</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="My%20pick%20on%20this%20matter">My pick on this matter</h3>

<p>I might sound both pro and anti natalist but mine is mostly
condition&#47;environment based.</p>

<p>In a few societies (such as mine), married couples tend to
marry to share the responsibility in a society instead of
out of true love. Which as a result, makes taking care of
each other as a responsibility instead of out of free will.
This creates problems in familial units in a society, often
such as ending up as a nuclear&#47;detached family instead of a
joint one.</p>

<p>Although I would say a nuclear family is suitable for a
modernized society due to its efficiency and distribution
of jobs and workplaces. But, the problem lies on the
responsibility, not the will to be together.</p>

<p>For example, if two people are married for the reason of to
be together and have children to make the society stable,
the family itself won&#8217;t be stable. They are doing this out
of responsibility even though they might have loved each
other at one point in life. This causes quarrels, fights and
conflicts within the family.</p>

<p>This ultimately ruins the grooming of the children and
hampers their rational thinking of the society. But we
cannot blame this on the parent&#8217;s fault either because they
are also groomed in such a way to think that natalism is a
natural obligation.</p>

<p>People back then supported natalism by a lot for the fact
that they have to continue their generation because the
mortality rate for children was very high. To continue the
civilization they thought it was justified to be natalists
and anti-natalism was seen as something bad.</p>

<p>But now, the need for children (don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t
mean it in a bad way) is a lot less than before and so
people reproduce a lot less. So people marry either out of
religious or natural obligations to maintain the society.
As I said before, it results in a bad environment for the
child to grow up.</p>

<p>My point is that I want to clarify anti-natalism is <em>not</em> a
bad thing and people should not be obligated to be a
natalist nor obligated to be an anti-natalist. These will
harm the future of their children if they wish to have or
destroy the society if they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>A solution for this is in my opinion is to encourage people
to think about natalism and anti-natalism for themselves and choose to
believe&#47;do which they want to without any influence from the
society or from the culture. They should do what they think
is best for them.</p>

<p>People are stupid. Yes, including me. This adds support for
one of my reason not to support democracy but that&#8217;s another
topic for another day. This is why we should get as much as
rational information for both sides and pour them out to
people so they may choose the best for themselves
consciously.</p>

<p>This is my take on natalism or anti-natalism. If I said
something wrong and you want to correct me, just contact me
on discord or send me an email to

reading my worthless stupid opinion about another mundane
topic.</p>
