# Welcome

Greetings stranger, this is my personal site. Mostly contains anything that I have added effort to and has article related to useless stuff I cared much about sometimes. I have a few pages listed on top which may contain links you wanna check out. Other than that, just enjoy the shitty website!

I rarely update the **RSS** feed. Better if you don't follow it.

***recently I added a music stream to my site which streams music directly from my laptop***
[check](./music.html) ***it out if you wanna listen to some doujin music***
