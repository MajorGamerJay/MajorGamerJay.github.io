Greetings stranger, this is my personal site. Mostly contains stuff about me and has article related to things. I have a few pages listed on top which may contain links you wanna check out. Other than that, just enjoy the shitty website!

I rarely update the **RSS** feed. Better if you don't follow it. :P
