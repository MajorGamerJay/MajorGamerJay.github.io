Here is music streaming from my laptop. If the music doesn't work, it's either
your browser doesn't support music or no music is being played on my laptop. Usually
there should be music playing on my laptop unless my laptop is in maintenance or I'm
away from home. Most probably it's the first one because in case of the latter one, I
would've notified.
