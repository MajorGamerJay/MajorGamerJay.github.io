# Travelling

I rarely travel but when I do, I like to take pictures of
sceneries along with it.

I collected some pictures so I might start a travelling series[^maybe].

It's mostly sceneries[^mis] and I try my best not to take photos
of people when capturing a beautiful scenery.

Here are some series:

    I don't like to take photos of people nor upload them. Because
    it gives me a feeling of not having their consent when doing it.
